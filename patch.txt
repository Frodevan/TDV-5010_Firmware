	Patch for Tandberg TDV-5000
	Frodevan, 2023-01-13
	Release 0.2


	Tandberg TDV-5000 series keyboard firmware v2.1, patched to make the extra
	keys useable on modern PCs and operaing-systems. To use this, burn it to an
	empty Intel 8751 (or other 8051-compatible), and replace the controller in
	the keyboard itself. Will only work with Tandberg-produced keyboards using
	Siemens-style switches (will NOT work with the later Cherry-OEM boards).

	Table with new scancodes for NOTIS-keys, along with new key functions.

	Please note that except for the GUI/App keys, Set 3 scancodes are very non-
	standard since I was unable to find good info on media-keys for this set.
	The firmware does not have the posibility to disable only set 3 for a key,
	so non-standard codes were used. If you have a keyboard-mapper, you might
	be able to work with this, but I can't promise anything. I will in any way
	recommend sticking with set 2 to get native support for these keys.

	After some testing, it was found that the Undo key won't work natively on
	more recent versions of Windows. However, its scancode can still be re-
	mapped to something more usefull. Included is a .reg file (stored as .txt)
	that will make the key become a volume-mute key instead, as well as a file
	to revert this (clear all scancode re-mapping).

	-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Changelog:

		r0.2: Fixing type of extended scancode patched keys. They were
		      previously adding the pre- and post-fixes used with the
		      navigation keys, and despite it working on my computer,
		      it might potentially confuse the PC keyboard-controller.
		      After this release these keys will produce clean extended
		      scancodes with no unexpected pre/postfixes.
